- title: PhD Candidate, McGill University
  from: 2019
  to: present
  description: Doctoral candidate at the Peyrache Lab, studying the head-direction system - the brain's internal compass - in freely-moving rodents.
                My research leverages electrophysiological and calcium imaging ('Miniscope') implants to study neuronal activity as animals learn and
                explore different environments. This has led me to develop skills such as fast and efficient decision-making and problem-solving, as well
                as analysis and visualization of the data acquired. 

- title: Honours Bachelor of Science, University of Toronto 
  from: 2015
  to: 2019
  description: I obtained my Honours Bachelor of Science degree with high distinction from the University of Toronto, majoring in both Neuroscience and Biochemistry, with a minor in French.
                During my degree, I received extensive experimental training in basic techniques used in biology and chemistry labs. This built organizational and time-management skills that
                are directly applicable to any experimental work. I also volunteered in two neuroscience labs during my undergrad and conducted my own behavioural experiments to write
                my undergraduate thesis, which further honed my time-management skills.
