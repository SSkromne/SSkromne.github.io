name: Local origin of excitatoryâ€“inhibitory tuning equivalence in a cortical network
tools: [electrophysiology, freely-moving]

description: We recorded in the cortical area of the head-direction system, where the majority of excitatory neurons are tuned to head-direction. By decomposing tuning curves using the Fourier transform, we show an equivalence in tuning between head-direction and inhibitory cells in this region.
