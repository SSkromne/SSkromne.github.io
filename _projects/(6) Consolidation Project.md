description: We tested the effect of memory consolidation on behavioural flexibility, or the animals' ability to adapt to changes in value as well as changes in optimal sequence of actions. We find evidence to suggest that memory consolidation reduces flexibility, particularly for changes in the optimal sequence of actions.
