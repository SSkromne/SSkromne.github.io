name: Hyperpolarization-activated currents drive neuronal activation sequences in sleep

description: We characterize the sequential activation seen along the dorsoventral axis in the postsubiculum during NREM sleep. Results suggest spatial gradients in I<sub>h</sub> result in the observed dynamics.
