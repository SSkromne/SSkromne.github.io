name: Visual objects refine head direction coding
tools: [electrophysiology, head-fixation]

description: By showing mice images of real objects versus scrambled versions of the objects, we demonstrate that the head-direction system is preferentially activated by images of real objects. This is surprisingly not observed in areas related to the visual system. Additionally, we find that visual objects refine coding of head direction.
